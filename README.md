# Survey form with React

This weeks assignment was to build a survey using React. 

## The problem

I started this project deciding on a witchy theme, then I continued by looking for fonts and background images on Pixabay and Google Fonts. I decided I wanted a form with multiple steps where each step represented a new page. I started adding the components for each input type and applied logic to show them separately. I considered re-using a component for question 1 and 4 but ended up creating two different components (it didn't work out using one and time was running low). 

If I had more time I would have added a function that allowed the user to go back to the previous questions. Some validaton for the inputs would have been nice as well.

Technologies used: CSS, JSX, React, hooks, UseState, components.
